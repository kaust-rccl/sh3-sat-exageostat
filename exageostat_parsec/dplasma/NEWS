This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of DPLASMA since
inception (basically the split from the PaRSEC project).

 - DPLASMA does not depend anymore on external COREBLAS or PLASMA, but only on BLAS
   and LAPACKE

 - Split DPLASMA and PaRSEC into separate repositories. PaRSEC moves from
   cmake-2.0 to cmake-3.12, using targets. Targets are exported for
   third-party integration

 - Add support in the runtime for user-defined properties evaluated at
   runtime and easy to export through a shared memory region (see: PR
   229 visualization-tools)

 - Change several default parameters for the DPLASMA tests.
 - DPLASMA:
   - Add the doxygen documentation generation.
   - Improved ztrmm with all the matrix reads unified.
   - Support for potri functions (trtri+lauum), and corresponding testings.
   - Fix bug in symmetric/hermitian norms when A.mt < P.
