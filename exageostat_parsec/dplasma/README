DPLASMA  is the leading implementation of a dense linear algebra package
for distributed heterogeneous systems. It is designed to deliver sustained
performance for distributed systems where each node featuring multiple
sockets of multicore processors, and if available, accelerators like GPUs
or Intel Xeon Phi. DPLASMA achieves this objective through the state of
the art PaRSEC runtime, porting the Parallel Linear Algebra Software for
Multicore Architectures (PLASMA) algorithms to the distributed memory realm.

DPLASMAâ€™s feature set includes:

Linear systems of equations (Cholesky, LU [inc. pivoting, PP], LDL [prototype]).
Least squares (QR & LQ).
Symmetric eigenvalue problem (Reduction to Band [prototype]).
Level 3 Tile BLAS (GEMM, TRSM, TRMM, HEMM/SYMM, HERK/SYRK, HER2K/SYR2k.
Covers double real, double complex, single real, and single complex (D, Z, S, C) precisions.
Provides ScaLAPACK-compatible interface for matrices in F77 column-major layout
Supports: Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, UN*X (depends on MPI, hwloc)

For a long period, the DPLASMA library was part of the ICL PaRSEC project,
a generic framework for architecture aware scheduling and management
of micro-tasks on distributed many-core heterogeneous architectures.
