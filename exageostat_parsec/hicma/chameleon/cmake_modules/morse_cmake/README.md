MORSE CMake modules
====================

This project provides a collection of CMake modules that can be shared
among projects using CMake as build system.

For now it is mainly constituted of "Find" modules that help detecting
installed libraries on the system. These modules are located in

Get morse_cmake

Documentation

See the file [morse_cmakefind_doc.org](modules/find/morse_cmakefind_doc.org).

Installation
---------------------

To use MORSE modules you have to add the path to the modules in your
CMake project and include the MorseInit module:

    # Define where are located module files on your system
    set(MORSE_CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "/where/is/morse_cmake" CACHE PATH "Path to morse_cmake sources")
    # Append this directory to the list of directories containing CMake modules
    list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${MORSE_CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}/modules/" )
    # Include the init module
    include(MorseInit)

We recommend to use this project as a `git submodule` of your project.

Testing
---------------------

See the file [README](modules/find/tests/README.md).
